👋 Hi, I’m @gohkokhong, a Business Architecture Senior Analyst with experience in Agile methodologies, automated testing, and application development.

👀 I’m passionate about technology, with hands-on experience in Java, Pega, Selenium, MERN stack, and Python.

🌱 Currently mastering the MERN stack and exploring emerging technologies. I've used MERN in projects involving machine learning pipelines and interactive data visualisation.

🔭 My projects include web apps, automated testing tools, and production features using Pega. I've also developed a CCA Management System using Vue.JS and Firebase, and proposed a revamped design for the Shopee app.

🤝 I'm a team player with a track record of leading initiatives to enhance efficiency and user experience.
